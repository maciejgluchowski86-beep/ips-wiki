# Generalized patch representations

> **Research-branch section.** This section exists only on `research/generalized-patch-representations`. It is not published on `main`. Statements marked as current research have not automatically completed independent audit.

This section develops extensions of the patch representation from binary flip spin systems to more general interacting particle systems.

The binary benchmark is the canonical manuscript *Patch representations and convergence for facilitated spin systems* under `paper/`, together with the existing [patch](entries/patch.md), [successful interaction](entries/successful-interaction.md), [monomial duality](entries/monomial-duality-for-spin-systems.md), [patch representation](entries/patch-representation-of-spin-systems.md), and [patch positivity](entries/patch-positivity-property.md) entries.

The generalization programme keeps the same structural order:

1. choose a tensor basis for local observables;
2. derive a local signed Feynman--Kac dual;
3. identify a coarse successful-interaction skeleton that hides a finite local mark;
4. prove conditional factorization into generalized patches;
5. define patch contributions and a nonnegativity criterion;
6. derive comparison/convergence consequences and test concrete models.

## Current pages

- [Finite-state typed tensor duality](generalized-patch-representations/finite-state-typed-duality.md): canonical reference-state indicator basis, typed active configurations, exact local signed dual for general single-site replacement rates, and the first successful-interaction record.

## Current bottleneck

The next theorem is conditional factorization for the typed successful skeleton. The main new issue is that an incoming typed target can conflict with a different active type at the target site, while an outgoing record now carries an explicit pre-interaction source type. The programme must determine whether these constraints still decompose into one source--time-strip consistency event per patch.
